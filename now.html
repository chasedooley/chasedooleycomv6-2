title: What am I doing now?

<h2>Home routine</h2>
<p>
  I wake up at 5 AM, make some coffee, and complete my morning preview, a
  journal entry. By 5:30, I'm reading, and I won't stop until 7 or so. I start
  by reading my philosophy, of late the Discourses of Epictetus, before moving
  into other books. At 7 AM, I start my work, whatever tasks are to be done, and
  I'll go until noon with a break somewhere in-between.
</p>
<p>
  Noon to one is for lunch and break, and after one, I try to take a nap if my
  work's on track, usually 90 minutes or so. The afternoon and evening are spent
  working on tasks and finishing up whatever's left. At 6 PM, I call it a day
  and start my evening routines: shutdown the computer, turn down the lights,
  complete my daily review, write in my journal, and read until 8, sometimes 9,
  when it's time for bed.
</p>

<h2>Developing</h2>
<p>
  I'm itching to work on some ideas for microsites and web apps for a while, but
  was held up with my site. The ideas include a site for web tools that I use
  often, code demos, and website recreations, and more. I'm also practicing my
  JavaScript, and I'm learning web typography. I'm always learning to improve my
  craft.
</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>
  I've not written in a while, but I have a lot of ideas for nonfiction and even
  fiction works that I want to jump on. I'll be writing every day for the
  foreseeable future, as desired.
</p>
<p>
  I also have an idea for a weekly newsletter or digest: a feature of the things
  I've done, found, enjoyed, and so on.
</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>
  I read every day, usually something of philosophy followed by a contemporary
  fiction or nonfiction book. Right now, I'm reading:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Discourses, Fragments, Handbook</em> by Epictetus, the Robin Hard and
    Christopher Gill version.
  </li>
  <li><em>The Great Gatsby</em> by F. Scott Fitzgerald</li>
  <li><em>The Greatest Salesman in The World</em> by Og Mandino</li>
</ul>
<p>And I just finished:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch</em> by Henry Miller</li>
  <li><em>Improve Wisdom</em> by Patricia Ryan Madson</li>
  <li><em>Do The Work</em> by Steven Pressfield</li>
  <li><em>The Alchemist</em> by Paulo Coelho</li>
</ul>
