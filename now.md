## Routine

My routine is a little bit of a mess right now, as I'm in a bit of a slump. I burned out on my previous routine. So, I'm not really writing at 7:30 nor am I working by 11. (I didn't start my tasks until 11 today.) My days are unproductive, with me goofing off on Youtube. My hope is that I'll soon get back to something that works and does not burn me out so bad. Dips happen.

My current routine, the one I'm trying to get back on, is this:

- 05:00 I wake up, I make coffee, and I use the bathroom.
- 05:30 I read.
- 06:30 I go for a walk in the park.
- 07:30 I come home, get dressed, and start writing.
- 09:00 I take a break and eat breakfast.
- 10:00 I start on my tasks.
- 12:00 I take a break and eat lunch; sometimes I goof off.
- 01:00 Maybe I'll get back to my tasks
- sometime between 3 and 5, I eat dinner.
- 05:30 I finish up my tasks and begin to "shut down" for the day. Evening rituals.
- 06:00 I journal and prepare for tomorrow. Then I read.
- 08:00 I go to bed.

## Reading

I read (almost) every day, usually something of philosophical followed by contemporary nonfiction. Right now I'm reading:

- _Two Essays on Analytical Psychology_ by CG Jung.
- Some selected fiction from Anton Chekhov.

Up next may be:

- _The Hero With a Thousand Faces_ by Joseph Campbell.
- _The Writer's Journey_ by Christopher Vogler.
- _A Guide to the Good Life_ by William B. Irvine.
- _Essays_ by Michel de Montaigne (the [Early Modern Texts version](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/montaigne)).

I last read:

- _Moonwalking with Einstein_ by Joshua Foer.
- _Deep: Freediving, Renegade Science, and What the Ocean Teaches Us About Ourselves_ by James Nestor.
- _When Breath Becomes Air_ by Paul Kalanithi.
- _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius (Hays Translation).

Soon I hope to launch an official page tracking my readings, [much like how Derek Sivers has his "book" page](https://sive.rs/book). Until then, this'll have to do.

## Other stuff

So, what else am I doing?

- I'm applying to jobs, looking for something I can fall into for a bit. You know, start my career and all.
- I'm rewriting and republishing the best of my writing, because I published a lot of shit since last year. A lot of my writing just isn't valuable to the reader, and that's unacceptable to me now. This is also an excuse to keep improving my craft.
- Working on myself, as I'm trying to sleep better, exercise more, and eat healthier.

## And what do I want to do soon?

- Self-study engineering. I'm thinking of a career in that someday, when I get back on my feet and can afford college again. (Within 5 years.)
