The source of self-deprecation is the lack of love for oneself. One can lack love for oneself for many reasons, but they all lead back to existence and meaning. The one who lacks love for themselves also lacks meaning for their lives. This is evident because meaning justifies our life, our suffering. Without meaning, our lives can become consumed by our suffering. We hurt, and we express that hurt in self-deprecating comments and the like.

There are three ways to combat self-deprecation:

One. Create meaning. We create meaning when we discover something in the world that makes a good impression on us. Anything, anyone can make a good impression on us. We must recognize these impressions. It will feel normal when we do, as if we discovered something new that we like, like a new friend or song. So,

- what are your favorite songs? Listen to them.
- what do you like doing? Do those things.
- what are your favorite books, writings? Read them.
- what are your favorite art pieces? See them.
- what are your favorite movies? Watch them.
- where do you enjoy being? Go there, if you can, or look at photos of that place.
- who are your favorite people? Hang out and talk with them.
- who do you love? Be with them.

Make a list of answers to these things. This is your inspiration to live. Every day you should review this list. You should feel inspired to live when you do. 

Two. Become grateful for living. Gratitude is a powerful force we can tap into when our hurt becomes too much. Every day, write a list of five things you are grateful for. They can be anything so long as you are truly grateful for them, and you should vary them every day. Try not to repeat yourself. You may feel strain in coming up with new things to be grateful for, but that's normal and even expected. As an example, here's what I'm grateful for today:

1. Waking up early to peace.
2. Doing my good work.
3. For all my common luxuries, power and water
4. For deep (good) sleep
5. That my day has potential.

Three. Forgive yourself. We make mistakes, we're human. When we hurt, it's not our fault. *Life is suffering.* It's not our fault. Whenever we make a mistake or self-deprecate, we should say to ourselves this mantra:

> I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you.
