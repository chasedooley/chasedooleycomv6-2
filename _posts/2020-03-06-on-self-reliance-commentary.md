The other day, I found and read a version of ["Self-Reliance," Ralph Waldo Emerson's most notable essay](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16643/16643-h/16643-h.htm#SELF-RELIANCE 'Gutenberg Project: "Self-Reliance" by Emerson'), by [the Domino Project](https://www.thedominoproject.com/). It includes commentary and quotes to important ideas found in Emerson's essay. It's a decent version of the essay, but I do have a big gripe about it.

I wish the Domino Project went further with their commentary rather than use so many quotes. After all, Emerson writes that "man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say 'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes some saint or sage." Emerson is saying that man has no trust in himself to use his own words, to say bluntly and truly what he believes, but rather he must rely on the words of others as his authority. This is one of the biggest ideas of "Self-Reliance," yet the Domino Project quotes Judy Garland in direct response to Emerson's quote above. How ironic is that? Much of their commentary is quotes from "some saint or sage" or some other person of notable qualities, and often what they quote is unrelated to Emerson's ideas.

The Domino Project proves Emerson's point that man absorbs ideas from talented characters, those who have authority and self-reliance, and is poised at all times to regurgitate those ideas, but he does not think for himself. He is afraid to say what he believes, to speak truly from himself. We do not think for ourselves nor offer to the world what we believe. The Domino Project appears not to think for themselves nor offer to their readers what they think about Emerson's writing. They praise the essay in their introduction, but they didn't meet Emerson halfway with original, unique commentary, and that's a shame.

With that said, I like what the Domino Project attempted. I think it's a valuable idea, so much so that I wrote my own commentary to some of the ideas they selected from Emerson's text. I did my best to speak from my head and avoid the beliefs of saints, sages, and sycophants.

> **"Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events."**

The iron string is the trust in yourself, and what Emerson means by it is that what you accomplish in life depends on whether or not you trust yourself. Domino Project includes this quote from Henry Ford, "If you think you can do it, or you think you can't do it, you are right." It's true, and a nice summation of Emerson's point. Doing your great work depends on you and your trust for yourself. If you do not trust yourself, then you will not accomplish the work you were destined to create. If you do, then you will have the courage to work through hardships and complete your great work.

Emerson in his second sentence is telling us to accept providence; to accept our fate in our position. I don't think he means to accept our position such that we cannot grow out of it, but rather that we all have a certain thing we're supposed to do, even if we're not wanting to do it. Marcus Aurelius wanted to be a philosopher but was chosen to become the Emperor, and he led that position nonetheless with virtue. Friedrich Nietzsche had his _amor fati,_ "love of fate."

History has numerous examples of people embracing what Fate has given them. Why do they always embrace it? Because in some sense you have no choice. Fate or Providence wants you to do this — it is your _fate_, your _destiny_. You cannot go against that. But you can postpone it. Steven Pressfield had this idea with shadow callings — things we take up thinking that they're our true callings but in reality are only distractions from our true work. Shadow callings are our postponing of accepting our destiny. But should you postpone your fate, given you have the chance?

No. We become miserable when we suspend our fate. We halt our progress in our lives, and we feel as if we're stuck in motion. Life is passing us by, but we cannot (for whatever reason, it seems to us) to move with it. We don't know what we want to do with ourselves: whether we want to pursue one path, perhaps that of an artist, over another of scientist or entrepreneur. We don't know ourselves, because we are not learning about ourselves. All of this, and more, translates into distress: the feeling that we're misliving our lives. We feel an immense fear for our future as if with each passing moment, it becomes more likely to be lost and ruined.

To love fate is to give into it freely, to stop chasing shadow callings and to pursue what you're good at and love to do.

> **"But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat \[great brilliance\], he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must not enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges, and having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unfrightened innocence, must always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private, but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men, and put them in fear.**
>
> **These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members."**

Emerson is saying that we become our own, and as such, affected by the outside forces of Society, when we first begin to speak or act from our own — when we "once acted or spoke with eclat," meaning that we employ our unique brilliance of display. We begin to become who we are, and not a reflection of our parents, siblings, friends, etc. We begin to express our unique characters.

When this happens, we become affected and influenced by the outside forces, by Society. Those forces will influence us whether we want them to or not. So, it's important to limit that effect as much as possible. It also means that we have lost our childhood innocence; we've entered the real world. We've entered the arena of Society and must be prepared to battle. We can no longer use our innocence, our neutrality, to defend ourselves from the world.

Those who have kept their youthful integrity, or had rebuilt it in their later years, are among the strongest in society. They are formidable, as their words can put others into fear. They can also put others into motion. Their words are strong, confident, and penetrating — we know such people when we see them. President Lincoln, Prime Minister Churchill, Martin Luther King, Steve Jobs, etc.

But it is Society that affects our ability to do this. The toils of a collective whole are infectious and damaging to one's character, such that it takes someone unique diminishes them into someone indistinguishable from a member of the whole. Society's rules and programs, how to act and so forth in this circumstance or that one, what to believe over this and that, etc., is what causes us to become less than ourselves.

We lose our ability to hear ourselves over the rumbling noise of the collective whole. As such, we lose our ability to do what we need to do, to trust ourselves and think independently. Only then can we do our work, so that we can accomplish our life's tasks, to be social and such. We cannot be truly social, truly good to our fellows as the whole if we do not break from that whole. Why is it that all who have done wonders for humanity have their name known? It is because they broke from tradition, and they did something that went against grains, and in doing so, contributed to the human condition. Their contribution might be good or bad, but the rule remains the same: those who want to change humanity must step outside of the collective whole.

Now, this is not Society's fault but our own. We've lost our ability to resist the influences, to remain ourselves unaffected by the outside impressions. As Society has developed, its ability to affect has too. Today, we have dings and blongs — notifications breaking our focus — and websites designed from the ground up to keep us addicted, mindlessly watching and scrolling for hours on end. We have addictive foods loaded in sugar and fat that slowly kill us. That's not Society's fault; it's doing what it always did. Historically, Society has never changed. There have always been the same conflicts, just in different lights and with different faces. And if you look deeply, you'll find at the center those historical, fundamental problems that have existed since the ancient Greeks, and before. Those are the fundamental flaws of human societies, and we have to deal with them because they cannot be exonerated. It makes us into who it wants us to be if we allow it.

It's our fault for allowing these things to addict us. We wanted Facebook and YouTube and other social media. We wanted our foods to taste good, so good we lost our self-control. All of our faults are the result of our wants and misguided misgivings and allowances and tolerances. But we have the power within us to fight against, to develop our self-reliance. We need to accept our responsibility before we can resist those influences; to need to be more selective of what we allow to influence us. If we decide to interact with an element of Society, say to buy a meal from a fast-food restaurant or to shop at a supermarket or to watch movies and videos online, that decision needs to be our own; to be owned only by us. We need to be nonconformists, as Emerson says. We need to make us who we want to be. That requires self-reliance.

> **"Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition, as if everything were titular and ephemeral but he."**

To this quote, the Domino Project offers a quote of theirs, saying to "Follow your heart." I suppose that is one interpretation of Emerson's quote, but I think it's wrong. It goes against the fundamental point Emerson is trying to make: not to "follow your heart," but to follow your reason! I think most philosophers since ancient times have said to follow your reason where your heart, or your emotions, would chance lead you astray. Our emotions are what compromised us into our non-self-reliant ways, and is the source of our troubles. We should cultivate our minds for our ability to reason well whether something is good or bad, to our constitution, to our own beliefs. Marcus Aurelius said our first duty as a person is to be rational, and I think he had this point in mind.

Of course, we are emotional creatures for a reason. Our reasoning can fail us, or be ineffective in the circumstance. When this happens, we should not turn to our blind, influenced, and biased hearts — a wise person does not do this. Rather, we turn within ourselves, and go deeper, and find the answers in our moral intuition, the basis of our deeper self. Our moral intuition is our ability to tell good from evil and to determine what is meaningful to us. We cultivate a healthy moral intuition when we are Virtuous, living by our Cardinal Virtues. If we ask our healthy moral intuitions what is right to our constitutions, to our character and principles, and listen to it, we will find an answer. That answer will more be aligned, more real to our Self than any answer our emotions can offer.

Remember this: to use our minds for its intended purpose is to use our rational intuition. To use our Self for its intended purpose is to use our moral intuition. Together, they are the basis of healthy decisions and Self-Reliance.

> **"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall."**

A foolish consistency is a bad habit — doing the same thing because "that's how it's always been done" or "I have invested so much into it" or for some other reason. It's easier to continue down the wrong path than to stop and ask ourselves if it is helping or hindering us, but that's what we need to do. We need to ask often whether we're doing the right things for the right reasons because it is easy to waste our lives doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons.

What foolish consistency does is widdle a person's autonomy away: before long, they are a robot, an unthinking machine completing tasks that make no sense to them or their lives. This makes them miserable. It is easy to follow the set paths in life, but try and forge your own, and not only will you battle life, but you will also fight everyone who follows the normal paths. They who believe in societal tradition will be the first to build obstacles before you. They will question your motives and criticize your beliefs because you're a nonconformer.

> **"We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment. ... Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future."**

Virtue and vice are not a choice, but rather a fundament of one's character. Whether one has virtue or vice is dependent on their character, and it is through their character that they act. That is, their genuine actions reveal their character, and subsequently, their virtue and vice. This is the principle behind the saying, "Actions speak louder than words," because words can be manipulated, whereas one's actions come directly from their character. Someone who has self-reliance is noticeably different from others in their actions.

> **"\[t\]hat a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you, and all men, and all events. ... The man must be so much, that he must make all circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design; and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. ... A man Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius, that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man. An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; ... all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons."**

Someone with self-reliance and authenticity is the mover of the world; all those who are great have had those two characteristics, be from the ancient world such as Caesar and Jesus or the modern world with Martin Luther King and Steve Jobs. To say that "where he is, there is nature," is to say that the self-reliant and authentic person is the ultimate form of a natural human being. I think that is true.

There's a quote I have somewhere: "A man is not the consequences of his circumstances, but circumstances are the consequences of man." We create our lives. We make our circumstances. It is easy to believe the societal norm that life happens to us, that we are a product of circumstance, but it's not true. We can bring good to the world from our inner selves. We can do our great work. There is a reason why posterity follows those who are self-reliant and authentic: they lead the way, they forge their paths, and those paths transform humanity, bringing it further along in its aims.

And then they have legacies. Few can mention or discuss Apple, Inc. without mentioning Steve Jobs and what he did for the company, technology, and the world. He came, he transformed the world by doing his greatest work, and then he died — and that life had more impact than the lives of millions of people. Why? Because one man had self-reliance and authenticity to accomplish what God, the Universe, Fate, or whatever had in mind with him, and Jobs accomplished that destined aim with a passion that rivaled everyone else. Jobs created an institution for centuries to come. Just imagine what those millions could do with the same strength and conviction, with self-reliance and authenticity.

> **"Let a man know his worth, and keep things under his feet. ... \[it\] symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason, and finds himself a true prince."**

We become "princes" or "godly men" when we wake up from our stupor, from a nightmare that we lack some element to do great work akin to what others have done.

With our world today, at every turn and gaze, we find ourselves impressed by the wonders others have created, and perhaps we think, "How am I suppose to stand with those who built that skyscraper or fly that plane or wrote that book?" The great works of others can cause us to feel the insecurity of our ability when we are not using our rational intuition. How can my work be equal to theirs?

This is a trap. It is the result of our culture, so focus on consumption and worth that ignore reason. It is not our task to judge how valuable our work will be to others, but rather to bring that work into existence. We all want to make a great contribution, and hold ourselves to the standard of great contributions. But few can do that. Great contributions are reserved for those who have the self-reliance and authenticity, among other qualities, to bring them into existence. Few can be Marcus Aurelius or Mozart or Steve Jobs. We are simply not to their level, and that's okay. Though we hold ourselves to making great contributions, the real value for us is not in the size or grandeur of the thing, but that it exists at all. If we make small contributions and that is the maximum of our ability, then we should be happy and satisfied that we have done the job of our lives. We have contributed to the human legacy. We have paid the price of our being, and that is all that is asked of us in exchange for our existence.

The other day, I asked my mother what her legacy was, and she said it was being a mother, raising her kids to be great adults. She said that might be mediocre, but that's what her legacy is. I told her it wasn't mediocre — that was her destiny. Through raising great adults, she contributed to what she had to give the world. She did her good work, and she can continue to add to that. The point I tried to make is this: what matters is not how big or special your contribution to the world is, but your conviction to bringing it into existence, to bring it into the world. To do so requires conviction, work, and pain — it requires you to be self-reliant and authentic.

We all have what it takes to do our work and bring our contributions to the world. All we need is to realize this, to have the spark — the Real Willpower — to push through and stick to it.

> **"The intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind? ...**
>
> **Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life’s cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him."**

Imitation is a step in one's learning: the pupil is the imitation of their master. But the pupil must know when to insist on themselves; they must know when the master can no longer teach them. That what is left for them to learn cannot be taught: it must be cultivated internally. The master of Shakespeare is not the one who gave us _Hamlet._ That came from Shakespeare after he insisted on himself and after he found that his masters could no longer teach him.

The steps of learning are imitation, assimilation, and then innovation. Imitation and assimilation are done under the supervision of a master. The first is as I described: the pupil is the imitation of the master. They learn the basics to perfection. Then they assimilate their knowledge into understanding, with theory and belief and convention. Then, once they have assimilated the knowledge, there is nothing left for the master to teach. The pupil must become their own master: they must find within themselves what they believe, and modify what they know to their terms. They innovate their knowledge to their terms, to their Iron Strings, to their perfect circles. This is when a master is born, and from them comes all the great works of humanity. This is when Shakespeare becomes Shakespeare.

Know this: great works never come from a pupil. Nothing great comes from imitation or assimilation. Great work requires innovation, and only a master of their domain cannot innovate within it and produce something of great value to the human legacy.

> **"Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles."**

No external good can bring you peace; you must find it within yourself. We are externalized such that we believe in "magical somethings" that can solve all our problems, but such things don't exist. Nothing has that magical power: we gain and gain and find ourselves no better. This consumption is endorsed by consumer culture. It is no wonder why we bounce from things to things, looking for a better thing to suck dry like vampires of happiness.

But just look inside and you'll find peace there behind pain, mazes, shadows, black clouds, and silver linings. Once we've tapped ourselves again, then we can uphold our principles and Virtues. From there, all else grows and betters.
