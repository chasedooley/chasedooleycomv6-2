So last night, I slept on the floor of my bedroom. I laid out my foam yoga mat, and on that, I laid my heavy quilt. I had a blanket and two pillows — one for my head, the other for support. I arranged this makeshift bed such that I was able to stretch out across the floor, with my feet under my desk.

It was uncomfortable as expected: the foam and the quilt did not offer much for the support. That said, I found some comfortable positions sleeping on my side or at an angle, but sleeping on my back or my stomach was not. I managed to sleep most of the night, awaking up only a few times in the early morning.

At around 3 AM, I woke up and switch to my bed, satisfied that my experiment was completed. Yes, I can sleep on the floor. What a relief!

Why did I sleep on the floor? To embrace minor discomforts in my life, as the Stoics recommend to harden myself against misery and to appreciate all that I have. Sleeping on the floor is a minor discomfort because, for me, it is easily remedied by switching to my bed. The point, though, is that by sleeping on the floor, I am learning to appreciate having a bed and discovering that I can sleep without it.

Embracing minor discomforts stems from the principle that everything you have is on loan — that the nature of the world is impermanence, and that what we have will change either for better or for worse. By sleeping on the floor or by dressing down for cold weather, I strengthen my resistance to the absence of the things I use to take for granted. I learn to be satisfied with what I have rather than desire a better bed or coat. So, if what I have changed for the worse — say I lose my nice bed — then I would not be broken up about it. I will be okay with whatever bed I have, even if its the floor.
