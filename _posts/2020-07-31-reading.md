I read every day. As I read, I highlight quotes and bookmark passages  that I found useful for my life. One of these becomes the thought to  ponder that day.

Reading should be productive in this way. Pick out valuable ideas from books,  and work them over until they assimilate into our being. This serves to  better us. Reading is an interactive sport. But reading more won't make  us better unless we learn from it. The quality of reading matters more  than its quantity.

Do not fixate on how much you read. It matters less than what you think. Our goal as good readers is to find the maximum at which we read and still learn. Knowledge is not a linear function of reading, though people believe this. So some people read so much more that they neglect to learn from it.

Remember that it is not how much you read that matters, but what you learn from  your reading. Reading is an act of improvement, so make the most of it.
