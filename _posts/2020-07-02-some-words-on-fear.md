A friend said they were afraid of doing their good work. This is what I said to them:

> I'm afraid too. But we must not allow our fear to rule ourselves. Things must be done in spite of fear for the sake of our lives and our fellows' lives. We become better by pushing through it. There hasn't been a warrior in existence who hasn't felt fear before the his enemy.
>
> "Be brave my heart," wrote Archilochus, mercenary and poet. "Plant your feet and square your shoulders to the enemy. Meet him among the man-killing spears. Hold your ground. In victory, do not brag; in defeat, do not weep."


They said, "If only it were that easy." It's not easy but that's the point. "Life for me ain't been no crystal stair" (Langston Huges, "Mother to Son"). It's hard work. It's supposed to be hard because life is survival. The fearful weak won't make it; they'll be picked off by the stronger competition. Fear is what holds us back. I said to my friend:

> It's do or don't. Like with my writing. I'm afraid of it. Of not having good ideas or the skill needed to act on them. Other fears too. But most of all, I fear that I can make it. That I can succeed with my writing. So, it was do or don't. Either I act against my greatest fears and do what I am perhaps destined to do, or I don't and allow whatever life that may befall me thereafter.


I didn't do for many years. I went off to college chasing whatever seemed like a calling, and I found nothing but wasted time and more fear. Fear that I would mislive my life. Fear that nothing will work out. But one day:

> I decided to act. To do (to write), and that's made all the difference in my life. It's not great nor perfect, or anything close to those ideals, but I know that I'll be okay. I have faith in the Quantum Soup (Fate) that it'll turn everything right in the end. That it will all makes sense one day. That faith keeps me going, not in a straight line, but in one hell of a squiggly line. So be it. It'll all work out.
