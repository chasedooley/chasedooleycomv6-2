We decide what is enough by mastering our desire. We master our desire by ensuring that what we desire is worth its inevitable disruption.

Of the things we want, can we be satisfied with less, with the easily obtained? If so, then desire less! This does not mean to give up on our ambitions, but to ensure that our ambitions do not disrupt our lives more than what they are worth. Can we be happy wanting what we have? Then limit our desires. Of the things we own, can we live well without some of them? Then get rid of the excess. Of the things we do, can we do less but better? Then do less that's more meaningful and better. Can we eat less? Then one meal instead of three. Of our relationships, do they give us joy and company? Then promote them; and for our other relationships, have the empathy to end them. 

These are the questions we must answer to decide what is enough. These are the actions we must take to keep what is enough.
