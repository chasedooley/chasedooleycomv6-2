There are two schemes of self-development: self-help and self-improvement. Some think these are the same, but in my observations, these two are different. 

Self-help comes from within, whereas self-improvement seems based on "magical somethings."

Self-help bases itself on our ability to change; self-improvement denies that ability.

Self-help inspires our belief in the good of things, in solutions to our problems. But self-improvement exploits this to sell to us snake oil, it's magical somethings.

Self-help produces a real, lasting change in ourselves; self-improvement offers only temporary relief.

Self-help costs us effort and time. But self-improvement costs us money, and in the long-run, our time, energies, and lives.

Self-help is to self-actualization as self-improvement is to self-image actualization.

Self-help promises nothing but the real; the promises of self-improvement are an illusion.

Self-help is for us; self-improvement is for snake-oil companies making bucks off us.

Why does self-help work and not self-improvement? Because magical somethings do not exist. Self-help does not draw its power from magical somethings, but from our acceptance to changing ourselves. The acceptance of change is the change in itself. In a word, we only better ourselves because we accept that we can help ourselves.

> [I] realize that there is no help but self-help. Self-help comes in many forms: daily discoveries through choiceless observation, honestly, as well as wholeheartedly always doing one's best; a sort of indomitable, obsessive dedication; and, above all, realizing that there is no end or limit to this, because life is simply an ever-going process, an ever-renewing process.
