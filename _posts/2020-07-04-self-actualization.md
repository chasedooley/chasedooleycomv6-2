In my recent writings, I wrote that the purpose of life is to be alive and that meaning is created but not found. I briefly touched on the question of how to live. I offered that we should live through self-actualization.

What is self-actualization but the realization of one's potential being? So, to live for self-actualization is to live such that you realize the most of your potential being. In other words, living to be the best quality of yourself. This is living to be real. 

> And what is the potential man, after all? Is he not the sum of all that is human? (Henry Miller, Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch)


In a word, we should live to see how much "human" we can become in a lifetime.

But why should we self-actualize - why is that the right path to living? For two reasons. The first that the alternative, self-image actualization, is wasteful of our lives and energies. The second that we have a personal obligation to become our best selves.

>You, as a human being, have the right to be the best goddamn product that ever walked and work so hard that the business people have to listen to you. You have that personal obligation to yourself to make yourself the best product possible according to your own terms. Not the biggest or the most successful, but the best qualityâ€”with that achieved, comes everything else.
>(Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee: Artist of Life)


It is our choice to live in such a way, but only in doing so do we have the hope of achieving the lives we want.
