1. Life is suffering.
2. To be is to have limitations, and to have limitations is to suffer.
3. The purpose (function) of life is to be alive; to simply be.
4. It's not enough for us to be alive; we believe there has to be more to Life.
5. We must justify our suffering to feel alive.
6. Meaning (value) justifies our being; meaning makes us feel alive.
7. But, Life is meaningless like that of blank canvas or a sheet of paper; it has the potential to be valuable.
8. Objects in the world have the potential to make good impressions on our lives.
9. We create meaning when we discover the things that make good impressions on our lives.
10. We hold our meaning in the things that make good impressions on our lives; we call these things "meaningful" to us.
11. To find meaningful things, we must have a healthy moral intuition; we must know and preserve the difference between good and evil.
12. To have moral intuition, we must be virtuous.
13. To be virtuous, we must live with the four cardinal virtues: justice, wisdom, courage, and temperance.
14. Live with the virtues by sheathing our minds, limiting our racing thoughts.
15. Learn to quiet your mind by mastering your being.
16. Master your being through self-actualization.
