In a fall afternoon struts a wild roadrunner from the brushes of my backyard. He does not resemble the cartoon bird he's known for. Rather, he has white and brown feathers, with some dark reddish colors, and he stands about a foot of the ground. He doesn't say, "Meep meep," either.

As he zooms out of the bushes into the clearing, he stops and inspects his environment. He's looking for threats. He bobs his head, and his long tail feathers rise up to a sharp angle before lowering in sync with his head. Then, he takes a few steps forward, his tail feathers and head falling into streamline. He's quick, as roadrunners are known to be, and he shoots across the yard. Then, he stops again. He checks for threats again.

For the roadrunner, the backyard is safe during the day. His only contenders are the house cats, who wouldn't dare wrestle with him. So he moves in for what he came for: a drink of water from the kitty-pool, and maybe a snack from the grass.

What's strange about the roadrunner is his confidence. He moves with eclat. He is aware of himself in his environment just as much as he is aware of his environment itself. The roadrunner trusts himself. He would give anything short of a mountain lion a run for its meal. For a bit, he's the king of the backyard. Good luck to anything that tries for his crown.

What if we had the confidence of the roadrunner? We would trust ourselves. Only by having confidence, or self-trust, can we achieve our life's tasks. Yet most of us seem to lack what appears to be a natural characteristic. We are unconfident, untrusting of ourselves. If a roadrunner has confidence, why don't we?

Because we are too reliant on Society. A kid in college wants to leave because he believes it's not for him. He wants to go into a trade and follow his art. He knows he would be more successful on that path. Yet, he's afraid to withdraw without consent from his folks, mentors, and whoever else he looks up to. He's reliant on their trust in him as if he's an empty vessel whose worth is judged only by the volume of its contents.

If he stays, he will be miserable. But if he trusts himself, he will leave college and forge his own path. He has the self-reliance to do that because he knows deep in his soul what he must do to achieve his life's task. He will allow nothing and no one to stand against him. He knows that he will succeed.

For the roadrunner to have confidence, he has trust in himself, he has belief in his abilities. We do not trust ourselves, and we lack confidence. We lack our individuality. It is easier to trust in the community, in Society, than to trust ourselves. Yet, to achieve our life's tasks, we must become self-reliant and self-trusting. This is harder. At every moment of nonconformity, Society is there to beat you back into conformity.

But you must find the courage within you to trust yourself, or you will never achieve your life's tasks. Be yourself. Trust yourself, and you will find peace in your life.
