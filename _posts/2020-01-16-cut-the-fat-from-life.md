I enjoy my steak after I have cut the fat from it. The fat disturbs me; its texture and chewiness weird me out such that I cannot eat it, and so I spit it out. If I have a steak before me, I pride myself in cutting the fat from it. Now, fat is a necessary component when cooking the steak, as it provides much of the good flavors, but after that, I prefer to eat as little of it as I can. My priority is protein.

I also apply this logic to my life. I love cutting out the fat from life — the stuff I deem useless, chewy, and inedible. This process is therapeutic for me, as I find enjoyment in the elimination of useless things. This process is defining what I can eliminate without disrupting my life, and then refining that useless thing out of my life. It's revision, like that of an essay. By revising my life, I regain the energy I spent on what isn't essential. Then, I can apply that energy to the essential facts of life. The result of this is a simple yet good life.

But why am I fascinated by a simple life? Well, it's the same reason Thoreau gave — he said, "I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived." I want to do the same. Through simplicity, one focuses themself on the vital pieces of life, of the things they deemed wildly important. They will find the truest facts of life.

I think of myself as a monk in this regard: someone who applies simple living such that their life is dedicated to precise aspects they have deemed important for living their good life. This appeals to me. So, if I was to become a monk, what would I cut out? What is unimportant to my good life?

The easiest target is my belongings. I have unused items that can be discarded or donated: clothing, books, papers, boxes, care items, wires, computers, et cetera. If they are not used because they lack purpose to me, why should I keep them? There is no reason for them to still be here, and if I can get something out of disposing of them, then it is obvious that I should.

Another target is my interests. I’ve used Warren Buffett’s “25-5” or “2-List” method to reduce my interests before, but I failed to reduce them in regards to my career goals. See, now my interests are essaying, philosophy, rhetoric & writing, breadmaking, and mathematics. I did not think of them in terms of my career goals, and as such, there are useless ones such as breadmaking and mathematics. Yes, I think those things are interesting but they are unrelated to my goal of becoming a philosopher. As such, I must eliminate them. I need to redo this exercise again, this time making an effort to do it right.

A hard target is my website — which has been the source of absolute frustration. For some misplaced reason, I decided it is important to have my site in such a precise way — a focus on typography with minimalistic and brutalist influences, coded up from scratch by me. But a year has passed and my site has experienced a lot of changes, none of which I am happy with. I think this is the result of misplaced focus. It’s not important that my site looks nice, but rather that my site does exactly what I need and nothing more. So, if my essays are important as I think they are, I will be thrilled to cut this annoyance from my life.

Why are these things, and others unnamed, unimportant to my life? Because they are personal rather than humanistic — they do not uphold my social duty, which is to do good in the service of humanity. Marcus Aurelius said this was the second function of man, and the first is being rational. Together, the reward for upholding my duties is a good life. But the things above — my belongings, interests, and goals, etc. — do not serve humanity, they serve me. And in doing so, they harm me. They are black holes that suck up my energy which could be used for my social duties. They are a waste of that energy, so they must be cut from my life.

How did my life become riddled with excess? I allowed them in as a result of giving in to external influences. Society is a complex organism that imposes its complexity upon its parts. And if those parts were not to resist it, they would, as I have become, riddled with distraction and personal, unhumanistic goals. For instance, consider the notification on a smartphone for an email: first, there is an audible ding; second, there is flashing light; third, and last, is the card which contains the information of the email. What does it say? Twenty percent off expensive T-shirts, or some other useless information. That is not humanistic — it's a distraction from life. It does no good for the bee or the hive.

This is why I think you can be your biggest obstacle. In one way, as I have with my website, I allowed something to distract me for personal reasons such that I forget the value and function of that thing. In another way, I enable myself to keep comfortable rather than push through pain and fear to reach my infinite potential to uphold my duties. The realization is that I can control what external influences reach me and affect me — I can decide to turn off my phone and hide it away, to cut out excess belongings, to focus my attention on the exact elements of my life, et cetera. I can choose to make an effort towards my duties as a human.

I can decide, now, to become better at being my best through the application of simple living. It allows me to focus on the things that do good for the world — my work — and ignore everything else. In living a simple life, I can gain mastery over it, and in doing so, gain mastery over my being. Then, I can do my sacred duties to the best of my ability. I know that I have infinite potential to do absolute good; the limiting factor is me, though. Do I have what it takes to push through the pain to reach that potential? In living a simple life, I think that I do.
