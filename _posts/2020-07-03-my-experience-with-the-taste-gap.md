I wrote before about my struggle with web development and design. It's a love, hate, love relationship. I love it because it's analytical and creative. I hate it because I'm always disappointed with my work.

Why? I thought it was because I didn't love it enough to get better at it, but I was wrong. The problem isn't between me and development, but my tastes and skills. This is called "the taste gap":

> "Nobody tells people who are beginners ... is that all of us who do creative work ... we get into it because we have good taste. But it's like there's a gap, that for the first couple years that you're making stuff, what your making isn't so good, OK? It's not great. It's* *really* *not that great. It's trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it's not quite that good. But your taste - the thing that got you into the game - your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can tell what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you..."

What a relief! It wasn't me that's the problem but a natural part of learning a craft. Everyone goes through it. This meant that I could focus on the solution: more work. Everyone starts with the taste gap. But only those who stick with their craft and do their work will get through the gap.

I remember this lesson every time I am disappointed with my work. I tell myself that it's just a part of the process. So don't stop making websites, but make more! If I stick with it, learn and improve, then one day I will be proud of my work.

And I will be proud of myself, knowing that I stuck it out and did my work when things got hard.
