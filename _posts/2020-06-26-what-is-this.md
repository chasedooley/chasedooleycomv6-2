All my ideas come from the garden of my mind. Like seeds, I want to nurture them so that they may become a healthy creation someday. So I water my ideas, I nourish them, and I cultivate them.

Some ideas don't germinate as a result of bad seed or skill. That's nature at work. Some ideas do take root, and they become little seedlings. By this point, they've outgrown the confines of my mind and need space and sunlight to grow well.

This website is their garden.

This place is as good as any for an idea to grow. Take a look around my garden and you see my careful preparations. Over there you will find my oldest plants, and here, a primed bed for new seedlings. In that corner will be a tool shed, fit with all I need to tend to my garden. There is fertilizer and there is water. Along that edge, I will plant the larger, more independent plants. This spot here is for the small ones.

It may take years of hard work and tender care for them to thrive, if they ever, but such is the work of a loving gardener. I work for the sake of my creations.

So, what is this but a garden for my ideas, writings, discoveries, projects, and revelations? A place of their own. This garden will be a monument to what I intend to do with my life. That is, to live close to the bone, as Thoreau once did, to discover what it means to live and to share those discoveries in my work.
