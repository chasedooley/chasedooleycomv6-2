I read and reviewed Dr. Michael Greger's How Not to Die the other week. It's about clinical nutrition; the links between what we eat and the diseases that kill us. Simply said, we're dying sooner as a result of our bad diets. The hope is that:

> The vast majority of premature deaths can be preventned with simple changes in what you eat and how you live. In other words, a long and healthy life is largely a matter of choice. In 2015, Dr. Kim Williams became president of the American College of Cardiology. He was asked why he chose to eat a strictly plant-based diet. "I don't mind dying," Dr. Williams said. "I just don't want it to be my fault." That's what this book is about: taking responsibility for your and your family's health.

In that respect, the book succeeded. I am taking more responsibility for my health. I'm eating more fruits and vegetables than I have ever before. To say that the book has changed my life is an understatement; the book will likely save my life. It motivated me to eat healthier so that I may live healthier, and as a result, longer and happier. (I recommend you read it, too.)

Still, I have a long way to go. It is difficult to change a diet that is so ingrained in your person. So, I eat as I did before, but with healthier foods sprinkled around. A big serving of strawberries with my Belgian waffle smothered in butter and syrup. Delicious, but harmful and unnutritious. A serving of broccoli goes well with my rotisserie chicken sandwich and side of potatoes. And what balances my big bowl of ice cream? Nothing.

It's good that I am improving my diet with more plant-based foods. But I recognize that progress only comes from sustainable means. I can do better. To know that what you eat may contribute to your death is one thing. To still eat the same food is another, a message to oneself that you lack the necessary love, conviction, and resolve to be better than who you are now. To conquer that is a monumental challenge in self-discipline and self-love.

And as Dr. Greger's book shows, this challenge is life and death. It's not enough to eat strawberries with your waffles or broccoli with your chicken. We must remove the harmful foods from our diet. It's not enough to promise ourselves to eat better. We are what we do, not what we say we'll do. Promises don't reverse disease nor does it slow the development of cancer. But the right diet does.
