> Philosophy calls for simple living, not doing penance, and the simple way of life need not be a crude one. The standard which I accept is this: one's life should be a compromise between the ideal and the popular morality**. People should admire our way of life but they should at the same time find it understandable.

Temperance is a cardinal virtue: it is knowing what is essential, what is excessive, and what is enough. The lesson is to find balance between the essential and the excessive.

The essential allows us to survive our lives, but not necessarily thrive. Think of water, food, shelter, heat, and medicine. We would die without these. Your life and environment also determines what is essential. As a writer, I need at least pen and paper to do my work, though a computer and a word processor helps a lot. A developer needs a computer to do their work. You need the Internet to find opportunities in the United States.

A life based only on the essential is asceticism, or a life of penance as Seneca said.

The excessive is what makes life pleasurable. Think of luxury estates, yachts, sports cars, millions of dollars, and feasts. These make life easier, more fun, and more comfortable. They ease our suffering to a point. But the pursuit of pleasure (hedonism) leads to the pursuit of pain and suffering. More does not make life better, but rather wastes its value. It adds to our suffering rather than ease it.

To live in either of these extremes is to mislive your life.

Should we want to live our lives well, we should turn to philosophy. It "calls for simple living," which is a balance between what is essential and what is excessive. A simple life is one in which the living knows what is enough for them to thrive, and desires nothing more or less than that. To want and have only what is enough, that is the goal of the simple life. What is enough depends on the person. You must decide what you will ask of your life, deciding what is enough for you to thrive.
