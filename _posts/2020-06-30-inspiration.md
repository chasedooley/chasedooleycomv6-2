Life is suffering; to be is to have limitations, and to have limitations is to suffer. That suffering must be justified if life is to be bearable. Meaning justifies suffering, and by extension, meaning justifies living. Meaning is the value of one's life.

We look into the world to find meaning. We look but we don't find it. Meaning does not exist in the world, and this makes us sad. When we don't have meaning for our lives, we feel as though our living is unjust. We suffer. We self-deprecate.

Life indeed is meaningless. Most of life does not need meaning to live; it is content to survive. But humans are different because it is not enough for us to be. We believed there was more to life, that there had to be more to life:

> Now summer is gone / And might never have been. / In the sunshine it's warm. / But there has to be more. 
>
> It all came to pass, / All fell into my hands / Like a five-petalled leaf, / But there has to be more. 
>
> Nothing evil was lost, / Nothing good was in vain, / All ablaze with clear light / But there has to be more. 
>
> Life gathered me up / Safe under its wing, / My luck always held, / But there has to be more. 
>
> Not a leaf was burnt up / Not a twig ever snapped ... / Clean as glass is the day, / But there has to be more. 
>
> (Arseny Tarkovsky, "But There Has To Be More")

So, we created meaning. Now there is more, but we forget where it comes from.

Life for us has the potential to be meaningful. The lesson is that we create meaning within ourselves. We create the value of our lives when we discover someone or something that makes a good impression on us. We attach that meaning to that person or thing. In a word, they or it holds the value of our lives. When something holds value for our lives, we say that thing is meaningful to us.

When we feel as though our lives are meaningless, we must remember that we create the meaning of our lives. We store that meaning in the things that prompted its creation. So, we must turn to those meaningful things and experience them. That will bring meaning back to our lives.

Keep a list of all meaningful things and people. Call it your "inspiration." When your spirit dips, turn to your inspiration, the meaningful things in your life. Listen to the music. Speak to your friends. Enjoy art. Love your partner. Go places. Do things, create things. Breathe. Relax your agitated mind with your inspiration. Be grateful for it. Practice your gratitude. Do this often, every day.
