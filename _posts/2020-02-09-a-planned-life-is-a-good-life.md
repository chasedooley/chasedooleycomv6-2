What am I working towards? We plan for the future so that we know where we're going — it gives what we do meaning. It connects the actions of your systems to the goals of your plan. For instance, my writing system relates to my goal of being a philosopher-writer: I know that every effort I make in my writing is a step towards that person I want to be.

If we know the path, it clarifies the journey. We do not have to spend time figuring out what we need to do next. We can apply more of our energy to our work and less to administrative tasks like extensive planning. This translates into better results for our work and our goals.

So, how should we plan? I think the first step knowing what areas of life are important to you, then deciding your dreams within those areas, then defining your top goals in reaching those dreams, and then developing systems around those goals. So, first, ask yourself: what is important in my life? These are your areas, which might include work, health, family, finances, etc.

Then, quiz yourself: if I had no fear, who do I want to be? What do I desire the most from my life in this area? In answering this exercise, I discovered I wanted to be a valuable philosopher-writer. This is my career path, which is an important area for me.

Next, to determine your top goals to reach those dreams, I recommend using Warren Buffet's ["2-List" Method](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus 'James Clear: "Warren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy: How to Maximize Your Focus and Master Your Priorities"') for each dream you have. Ask yourself, what am I doing? Where is my journey in reaching that dream right now? This is to clarify your scope: in answering, I say that I am a student of philosophy and writing. That's my current step in my career (my journey). Okay, now where do I want to go? What's my next step? To that, I say I want to get into a top-rated graduate program for philosophy.

Great! Now, what are 25 goals you have with the current step of your career that will transition you to your next career step? I write that list, then I determine the top five goals that are most important to my career. What will make or break my career potential? I select those goals. Congratulations, you have wildly-important goals!

Internalize them: translate each goal such that it relates to your ability if it doesn't already. For instance, if my goal is to get into top graduate programs, then I should rephrase that goal into working in my studies to the best of my ability since that is what determines my chance of getting into those programs. Do you see how these are the same, yet the later gives you absolute control of that goal? This is important because it separates what you have control over, even if it's just *some*, and what you have no control over. I have control over my ability but not over my acceptance to a program, but I can influence my acceptance through my ability.

Now, design systems around those goals. A system is better than a goal because it emphasizes your process. Your process is key: it is the determining factor in whether or not you reach your goal. And the system is simply the actions you do to reach your goal. For instance: I have a goal to write every day. My system starts with sitting down in my chair at 6 AM every day, then reviewing my ideas and previous work. Then, I start writing for an hour — how much I get done depends on how I feel and how my writing is going. If it's good, then I'll go until I finish the essay or my two hours are up. Usually, I finish an essay in an hour and use my second hour for revising and publishing my previous work.

Let's break this down again:

1. I sit down at 6 AM. Steven Pressfield says sitting down to write is harder than the act itself, and I agree, which is why this is my first action.
2. I review my ideas and my previous work. This is priming my mind to my process and my progress.
3. I start writing and will stop when I'm done writing. No word goal, that detracts from my process. Word goals emphasize quantity over quality.
4. I put away my new piece, and start revising my previous work. This is half of writing.
5. I publish my revised work, and my writing session is done for the day by 8 AM. I reached my writing goal for the day.

Note that they are a *system* of actions: *a process towards reaching a goal.* You should create a system for each goal you have in every area of your life.

An easy way for managing these systems is with checklists, as a surgeon or engineer or pilot would have. As you complete your actions, check them off. At the end of the session, all of your actions should be checked off. Then, you can track your progress. Do note that this is also a system in itself, complete with its actions. A wise effort would be to create systems down the line: a system for your goals, a system for managing and tracking those goals, a system for doing that, etc. until you reach a stable point.

Seneca said that "Life without a design is erratic. As soon as one is in place, principles become necessary. I think you'll concede that nothing is more shameful than uncertain and wavering conduct, and beating a cowardly retreat. This will happen in all our affairs unless we remove the faults that seize and detain our spirits, preventing them from pushing forward and making an all-out effort" (*Moral Letters*, 95.46). Accessing your infinite potential starts with designing your life, planning so well that each step is effortless in execution. Progress between each point in your life should feel as though it was inevitable, and we can make this happen. One could say that we have the _*free will*_ to _*determine*_ our lives, and this makes all the difference in them.
