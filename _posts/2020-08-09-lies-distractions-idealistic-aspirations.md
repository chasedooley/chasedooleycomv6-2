> The most damaging lies that we tell ourselves involve promises. “Nothing is so beautiful as a promise, right after it is given.” The evanescent quality of New Year’s resolutions constitutes a cultural cliché. Good intentions are more than paving stones on the road to hell, they are distractions from the serious task of evaluating who we are and what we really want. If we spend our time imagining some ideal of beauty or self-improvement, it drains energy and distracts our attention from more serious and attainable objectives.

Lately, I thought about medicine and becoming a doctor who serves the poor. I'm inspired by the story of Dr. Mohamed Mashali. He treated Egypt's poor for 50 years, often for free, seeing 30 to 50 patients a day. That's noble. It appeals to my good intentions.

I'm always imagining the possible futures I could have. 

It's an old habit. When I was college, I daydreamed so often about who I could be and what I could do that I forgot what I was doing and why I was there. The result was that I was always searching and exploring and never studying. My grades slumped, financial aid dried up. Then I dropped out.

What did Henry Miller say about writers? 

> An author hopes that in giving himself to the world he will enrich and augment life, not deny it or denigrate it. If he believed in direct intervention, he would be a healer and not a writer. If he believed that he had the power to eliminate evil and sorrow, he would be a saint, not a spinner of words.

I see now that this is true for all my idealistic aspirations. If I wanted to be a doctor, I would become one. But I make no effort to become one. The same is true for becoming a philosopher and mathematician. They're all idealistic aspirations laden with good intentions. All lies in essence, distractions from what's real in my life: being a writer and wanting the artist's life.

That doesn't mean I can't enjoy these things. I can study mathematics if I believe it appeals to my artist's life; it's an art in itself. The issue is that it's secondary right now. It's not important to my writing nor my living. Same for medicine, and all my other hobbies. Maybe one day I can enjoy them, but right now I need to focus on what's important to me.

So the lie Dr. Livingston wrote about is this: believing one thing and at the same time believing in its opposite. In essence, living a paradox. It is the writer believing in direct intervention as a means to improve life. Or a doctor believing that appeals to God will reverse their patient's cancer. We don't realize they're lies because we wrap them up in good intentions and idealistic aspirations. Distracted, even blinded, we stumble off the path of our lives, falling down into the weeds and trees of a fake living and a fake self, wondering how we got there and how to get back up on the path. The sad truth is that some of us never will return to their right path.

So, how can we handle these good intentions? 

1. Train ourselves to live in the present, and to let go of the end. We should have trust that what we most want will come back to us if we let it go. Let our lives be as they are and progress as they are meant to, that is natural and essential.
2. Ensure that our idealistic aspirations are centered on the present: what's real to us now, which is who we are and what we want. This is to prevent them from becoming distractions and to prevent us from lying to ourselves.
3. Taking a page from Derek Sivers, we can collect "possible futures." We expand on an idea, like my becoming a doctor for the poor, to include our intentions, resources, considerations, and plans, and whatever else that may go along with it. In essence, we're dumping everything about our idea into a collection. So if we decide in the future to change directions, we can review our possible futures and pick the best one for us.
