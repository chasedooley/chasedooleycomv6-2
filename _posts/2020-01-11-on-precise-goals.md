You need precise goals in your life. Each of these relates to a larger goal, which may relate to some high desire to accomplish. For instance, one might have the goal to run an ultra-marathon, and so their smaller goals might be to run a certain amount of hours every day and to train on their technique. Another example could be a student earning their undergraduate degree: they start with the high goal of earning the degree and reduce it to smaller goals. They need to achieve good grades, which would mean they need to master their studying habits, et cetera. Once a high goal is met, then one needs to select the next one. This process continues forever.

The point of having high goals and lower goals that are precise is to cut out the extra stuff that doesn’t have any value to you. There’s no value in doing something unrelated to your goals; if anything, it hurts you because that useful thing is wasting valuable energy better spent on something important. And one precision, the goal must be exact in definition: I will write 52 essays this year.

One thing to consider is that you may not reach your goal for certain reasons despite your highest effort, and in that, I can say that reaching the goal itself in this circumstance is not the point, rather, it is the attempt at that goal. So, if I write 44 essays instead of 52, I should still see it as a victory as I did not write that many before. Now, the next goal should be to hit 52, and my victory will only be reaching the threshold of 45 to 52. I keep going in this manner.

Some goals are like that, and some aren’t. You can fluff some but not others, and the point is to not allow yourself to stagnant. More so, you must be willing to push yourself far to achieve these goals — reaching 44 out of 52 essays is a great achievement, but you should use that victory as a leap pad for the next one. Failure is only if I write 43 essays, which is then a decrease in my output. Granted, you may have reasons for that, but if it's your goal to reach 52, writing less is not victory.

As for which goals to work on, use Warren Buffett’s “2-list” method. Only five goals should be active at any moment, and of those five you should be making exceptional progress. Remember: there are no excuses for failure.
