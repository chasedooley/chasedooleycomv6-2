A friend asked me if I wanted to leave a legacy, and I said to them:

> I want to do my Life's Work. That is my gift to the world, and whether it is recognized in my lifetime matters little to me. Van Gogh painted dozens of masterpieces and never found a buyer in his lifetime. His sister made him renown after his death. 
>
> If that happens to me, so be it. I will rest happy that I did my work for its sake and left the rest to Fate.
