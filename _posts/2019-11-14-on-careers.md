A career is one’s professional journey through their life. A profession is something that someone does within their career. A doctor is a profession whose career is that of being a doctor, but can also be that of being a parent, a writer, or a business owner, et cetera. Careers are made up of professions. So do not concern yourself with what you want to do as a career; do concern yourself with what professions you want to do.

There are two types of professions: callings and occupations. The ultimate goal of deciding professions to have one that does both; the penultimate goal is having one (or more) of each. A calling is decided by some higher power and driven by passion; it is your vocation, what you do because of some greater thing. A calling is the purpose of one’s life. An occupation is decided by an individual to survive; it pays your bills, buys your food, et cetera. A person becomes an occupation because it provides the means for them to survive, it serves a greater purpose, and it is enjoyable to them.

Expect that you will have multiple occupations in your life, and you may have multiple callings too. Never fear that you are stuck doing a profession; you can outgrow an occupation or a calling, and when you do, you can move on to a new one. Professions are not your career but comprise it: for most, a career is a book whose chapters are the professions of one’s life. It is very rare to find a career that is defined by a single profession.

When deciding an occupation, remember that it makes no difference what profession you do as long as it provides the means for you to survive, it serves a greater purpose, and it is enjoyable to you.

Remember that occupations can become callings; so, if you do not have a calling (you do not know your vocation), then choose an occupation and over time you may develop a passion for it or discover your calling.

Remember that a job is not a profession, not an occupation, but is any work that does not provide one or more of three criteria of an occupation. It may provide the means to survive, but it may not serve a greater purpose or be enjoyable to do. Use them as you must but avoid them as a whole.
