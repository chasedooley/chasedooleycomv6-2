**_Philosopher_:** "Who are you trying to become?"

**_Youth_:** "Someone who is respected, free, and happy."

**_Philosopher_:** "And how will you achieve these things?"

**_Youth_:** "Through study and work. My studies will grant me a job. Then, I can work hard. Through good work, I will gain respect. Respect will grant me a better job, one that pays more for less time and effort. I'll have the time, then, for the things I want to do. That's freedom. And, in having these things, I will have a happy life."

**_Philosopher_:** "And how long will this take?"

**_Youth_:** "Many years. A lifetime, even."

_Philosopher_: "In that path, yes. But you could have them sooner, for those things are easily obtainable. Freedom, happiness, and respect are the result of your choices. You can choose to be happy now, to be free, and to be respected if you make the right choices today. Everything that you seek in your life can be gained today through the right decision. You do not need to wait a lifetime for any of them."

This is the wisdom of a quote from Marcus Aurelius, who said that "You could enjoy this very moment all the things you are praying to reach by taking the long way around -- if you'd stop depriving yourself of them." Indeed, we often set long-term goals to gain something that is easily obtained now. For instance, I have sought degrees and education to earn a high-paying job so that I could find tranquility in my mind. I thought that if I had wealth and financial stability, I would be in peace to live my life.

This seems rational, and maybe it is, but I learned that tranquility can be gained from the choices that I make. This is a lesson from Stoic philosophy. I can decide now to have peace in my life: to not allow external influences to infect my mind with their poison, to seek the simple things in life, to dedicate myself to the service of the world through my work, to do my work to the best of my ability, and to be virtuous.

All of these are choices I have made in the past, and are choices I must make again every day. My life is the journey I take in making these decisions. What dreams I have at the end of my journey are not the point of the journey itself, but rather where I go, what I learn, and who I become, etc. Whether or not I choose to make the right decisions, whether or not I choose to gain today what I most desire from my life.

Why is it that we don't know that we can achieve our aims today? I think it is because we are too focused on our goals that we ignore the process when it is the process that is most valuable to us. It is through the process of reaching a goal that we have it. In achieving a goal, all that we have is its reward; but exercising a process, we have more: the changes we make, the actions we accomplish, the wisdom we learn. It is these things, and more, that build toward that goal, but it is also these things that provide the goal's reward. By prioritizing our process, we will have what we want.

For instance: Tranquility is important to me, but if I aim to have tranquility and work to gain it, then I will never have it. Why? Because in this mode, I am too focused on the goal of gaining tranquility to enjoy my process, and it is in the enjoyment of the process that one finds tranquility. In my process, I have found philosophy, writing, and wisdom. It is these things, and more, that make me satisfied with my life. My life is tranquil because of these things.

And remember, what is a process but a system of actions in accomplishing some aim or goal? Then in this, the choice is simple: do it or don't do it.
