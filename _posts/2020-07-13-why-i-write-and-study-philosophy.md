> “God wants us to be happy,” said Nijinsky. Likewise an author hopes that in giving himself to the world he will enrich and augment life, not deny it or denigrate it. If he believed in direct intervention, he would be a healer and not a writer. If he believed that he had the power to eliminate evil and sorrow, he would be a saint, not a spinner of words. Art is a healing process, as Nietzsche pointed out. But mainly for those who practice it. A man writes in order to know himself, and thus get rid of self eventually. That is the divine purpose of art. A true artist throws the reader back upon himself, aids him to discover in himself the inexhaustible resources which are his. No one is saved or healed except through his own efforts. The only genuine cure is the faith cure. Whoever uses the spirit that is in him creatively is an artist. To make living itself an art, that is the goal.

Some write because they have something to say. Truth is I don't have much to say, but I have much to discover. I write to know what's at the center of who I am. I write to heal myself from my life's suffering. I share my writing in the hope that someone will find a similar healing discovery within them.

I don't know why art heals. Maybe creating something helps us to expel and wrangle our demons, and that allows us to live better. I do know that it works. When my step-dad died, I wrote some poems and stories, and I felt better. When I had unrequited feelings, I wrote to ease them. When I felt lonely, I made things - websites, recipes, game shows - because people like it and gave me attention.

And I know that art requires faith in oneself to heal. Without that, it does no good. When I disliked myself, I wrote trying to heal. But it did not help; I had no faith. My writing made things worse. I disliked myself more. I felt more alone. I stopped creating.

Art is not the only healing process. I found that

Wisdom is a form of self-help. I study philosophy because I have much to learn. I practice wisdom to live a better life. Practical wisdom soothes a hardened mind, making it receptive to art. It returns faith to the soul. Once the mind is soft and faith has returned, then art begins to heal the soul.

I don't know why it works, but it does. When I disliked myself, I looked for help. I found stability in therapy, but not self-help. Then I discovered Alan Watts' lectures, and his wisdom helped me to relax. It gave me the strength to leave my life alone. It set me on the path to discovering Thoreau, Emerson, the Tao Te Ching, and the Stoics. Their wisdom continued to relax my mind and lead me back to my writing.

So, in a word, I write and I study as an act of self-help.
