Life is suffering, life is chaotic, life is uncertain. To live with limitation is to suffer as apart of our being. To live and accomplish our duties, we must work, and often our obligations can be excessive and suffocating. And to live, we can never know for certain of our future; I don't know if I will accomplish my goals, or if I'll die today or sometime soon in the future.

All of these combine into excessive suffering, which makes life harder for us to bear. But we must -- that is our purpose in life, to bear our suffering and do our primary duties, to be rational and to be social, through our good work. So, how can we bear life a little easier, how can keep focus, how can we have some certainty?

By having mantras, creeds, and legacies. These three things help to make life easier by offering solutions to these problems. Yesterday, I used one of my mantras to reduce my self-loathing after I used anger in response to confusion and miscommunication. Today, I read my creed to remind me of the person I am becoming, to keep me focused on my work, and to keep my standards high. And today, I reminded myself of the legacy I am working towards so that I can accomplish the most important goals for this aim.

I have these things tacked to my wall as a constant reminder and a consistent source of wisdom and relief. And I need them every day.

But what is a mantra, a creed, a legacy? The first is a saying that one can use in response to suffering. For instance, I used this Hawaiian mantra to curb my self-loathing: "I am sorry, please forgive me, thank you, I love you." It's an act of forgiveness for myself when I made a moral mistake. For me, it works. It worked yesterday.

I keep a collection of mantras that can be applied to many forms of suffering. The collection includes:

- "Looking good, feeling good, I should be in Hollywood!"
- "All good mental training"
- "I am a rational being"
- "My standard will remain perfection"
- "May there be happiness in all. May there be peace in all. May there be completeness in all. may there be success in all."
- "To what service is my soul committed? Who soul do I have now?"
- "Needs work!"
- "Discipline equals Freedom"

I chose these as I liked them. I found them useful in curbing the forms of suffering I have. In creating your collection, chose ones that you find valuable.

What is a creed? By definition, it’s “a set of fundamental beliefs” (1), but beyond that, I think a creed is like an oath: a sacred promise to the highest principles of one’s character and duty. Take, for example, the Sentinel's Creed: it describes the character of a Sentinel and their duty to honor and protect the Unknown Soldiers. I think it is the perfect example of a well-written creed.

It is why I based my creed on it, even quoting its first six lines. This is my creed:

"Though in the years to come This life will be hard and painful, I will endure my suffering, I will embrace my challenges, I will be disciplined and principled, And I will work to the best of my ability, Knowing that this will set me free. This is my promise to those who have come before, And this is my sacrifice for those who will come after. I will carry the mantle of time’s creations. I will honor the trust of the Muses, And I will ask them only to sustain this song for me. I am their Sentinel, I am their honor guard: “My dedication to this sacred duty is total and whole-hearted. In the responsibility bestowed on me never will I falter. And with dignity and perseverance, my standard will remain perfection.”

My creed embodies the aims of the Sentinel's, duty and character, but also serves as a reminder of what my chosen path will bring. I know that in the future, life will be hard, and if I am to be the person I want to be, I must face and endure those hardships. In this way, I think of myself as a soldier who has a sacred duty, something he believes in with conviction.

I'm focused as a result of having and reading my creed. I cannot allow distractions from my work, and I cannot allow myself to lower my standard. If I am to accomplish my legacy, then this is what I have to do. I get to make this sacrifice, and that's inspiring on its own.

To what legacy? This one: "Chase Dooley transformed the study of the philosophy of life and popularized _Lebensphilosophie_ for the general audience." It is a one-sentence summary of the life I want to live. Another example is Abraham Lincoln's "saved the union and freed the slaves." That is what he is known for, that is his legacy. That is what my legacy attempts to do for me, to remind me of what I am working towards.

My legacy is an attempt at clarity for the future. By knowing what is ahead, what I am working towards, everything that is excess falls away. Trivial matters are of no importance because they do not influence what will determine whether or not I achieve my legacy. You should write your legacy for the same reasons.

And of course, know that your legacy is not fixed until you die. I may find in the future that what I thought as the philosophy of life was a little different, and made changes to it. That's expected. The point is not to exactly define your life, but to plan for it; to know what you want and need to do, so that you do those things.

The point of having a creed, a legacy statement, and a collection of mantras is to reduce your suffering so that you can accomplish more from your life. So that you can, through your work, complete your duties as a human being. This is what anyone can hope to do in their life, and by having these tools, I believe one can do achieve those aims.
