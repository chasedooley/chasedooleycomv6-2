1. Wake up and go to bed on time: 5 am, 9 pm.
2. Get dressed.
3. Take care of your body: eat simply and well, clean and groom yourself, exercise.
4. Drink more water over anything else.
5. Have and follow your morning and evening rituals:
   1. Wake up at 5; make my bed; get dressed; get coffee; use the bathroom; start a journal entry; review for the day; read, starting with my philosophy, for an hour or so; write for two hours; publish some work.
   2. Clean up; shutdown my computer; brush my teeth; turn down the lights; plan for tomorrow; complete a journal entry; review the day; read for an hour or more; be asleep by 9.
6. Read for 30 minutes, no less. And act on what you read. Identify two or so big ideas or methods that seem useful to me, and apply them to my life.
7. Practice my craft at the same time every day without fail. My Muse does not respect dilettantes, amateurs, and dabblers. Those are often late and who do not love their work as She does. 
8. Work to the program, not to your mood.
9. Focus on the CORE FOUR over everything else, even your work and art. A true professional must know when to take care of themselves first. Because they cannot create anything of value without a healthy body and a stable mind. 1-3 is for the body; 4 is for the mind:
   1. Sleep,
   2. Nutrition,
   3. Exercise,
   4. Philosophy.
10. Practice my philosophy.
11. Journal as possible. Quotes, events, previews and reviews, thoughts, ideas, tasks, five "gratefuls," food diaries, etc.
12. *Listen* to music, not just as background noise.
13. Appreciate your life. List five things your grateful for. Make these things count. (The five "gratefuls" or gratitude exercise).
14. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or controlled-breathing
15. Remember to:
    1. Surprise yourself by learning something new,
    2. Surprise someone else by teaching them something new,
    3. Record these daily; reflect on them weekly.
16. Remember that life is finite: you will die. That's good for death is what makes life valuable. Meditate on this fact and its implications.
17. Avoid what seems to be addicting.
18. Don't break your routines, promises, or plans unless you're betting against your Life, your work, your Muse, everything you stand for, and the lives of others that have or will be affected by what you do and create.
19. If you must break a routine, ritual, promise, or plan, then have a damn good reason for it. Remember two things:
    1. Never break for more than two days, as you'd be better off starting all over then. All is lost after two days.
    2. During your break, you should feel anxious to get back into your routine. That's normal and good.
20. Have a damn good reason for failure. Learn from it.
21. Feel shame over feeling guilty. Hold yourself to the standard. "My standard will remain perfection." Remember *The Warrior Ethos*.
22. Beat Resistance at all costs or risk everything, everything, **everything**.
23. Keep learning the ways of the Universe.
