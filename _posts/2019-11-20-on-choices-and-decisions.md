There are choices and there are decisions. The choice is between options of something alike. There are two forms of choices: simple and complex. Simple choices do not matter; that is, their decisions do not affect anything of value. As such, simple choices have no value themselves and are unimportant, yet you often apply false importance to them. Complex choices do matter. Their decisions will either worsen or better aspects of life, either yours or others and as such, these choices are important and their decisions significant.

The decision is the option of most value compared to the other options at the time of deciding. We determine the value of options using our intuition, faculties, and recourses. At the time of deciding, we can know whether or not an option is good or bad, but we cannot know whether or not our decision is good or bad. We can only make the best decision at the time if you choose the best option.

Remember to make decisions quickly. Indecision comes from fear of making a decision, and it is worse than making the wrong decision. Nothing can be gained or learned from indecision, yet it has all the same (or more) costs of a wrong decision. So be quick to decide: if the choice is simple, be quick to eliminate it; if the choice is complex, be quick to access your options and be quick to decide on one.

Remember to be indifferent to your decisions. Few choices (even great complex ones) matter with time, and as such most decisions become more insignificant the longer they last. So when you decide a choice, be indifferent to your decision; that is to say, do not worry yourself with the consequences of your decision or “what could have been.” You alone can make the best of any decision, be it good or bad. Decide quickly and live what comes.

Remember to not regret wrong decisions. Know that you made the best decisions with what you had (your ability, knowledge, resources, and intuition) at the time if you tried to find the best option. Learn from your wrong decision and better yourself for future choices.

How do I decide on simple choices? Remember that you should eliminate simple choices by deciding on an automatic decision. This is turning a simple choice into a complex one, and from there, deciding the best option. If you don’t have the time to eliminate a simple choice, then choose randomly; remember that simple choices have insignificant decisions, so it does not matter what you choose.

How do I decide on a complex choice? Start with identifying your options, and seeing if there is a best option apparent. If so, you should go with it. Otherwise, you should determine the value of each option so that you can eliminate bad ones. Once you have reduced your options, you should reassess whether or not there exists the best option. If not, decide using a coin flip or dice roll. This will provide you with an option, or it may even reveal the option you want the most.

How do I determine the value of an option? Start by learning about each, then:

1. Determine if the option is realistic by accessing its likeliness to happen
2. Determine if the option meets your needs
3. Decide if the option meets enough of your wants
4. Consult others on the value of each option
5. Assess each option with a pros and cons list

What if my options are equal in value? Then choose randomly, using a dice roll or a coin flip. Remember that in such situations, it makes no difference which option you choose.
