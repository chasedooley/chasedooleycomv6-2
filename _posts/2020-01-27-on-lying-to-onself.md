One of Dr. Jordan Peterson’s “12 Rules for Life” is to not lie. I think this is an important rule as it stands, but it is especially important to not lie to yourself. Because lying to yourself makes you weak in that you seek comfort. It is believing that your indulgence in your weaknesses is the same as upholding your principles; that one cookie doesn’t matter in a decade if you have the self-control to resist other temptations. I can only assume, though, that someone who lies to themself is trying to protect their weaknesses.

Why would someone want to do that? To stay comfortable. It is the reason, I think, why someone lacks self-discipline: they lie to themselves so that they don’t have to face the uncomfortable facts or activities of life. If they live in a fantasy world in which their lies are true, then they would not have to commit themselves to important causes. Why not eat a cookie if I’m walking every day? Doesn’t the exercise balance an imperfect diet?

No. It may be true — or not, I’m not a nutritionist — that the right amount of exercise can balance an imperfect diet, but that’s not the point. You don’t eat the cookie because it sets a precedent in which it is acceptable to eat cookies while trying to build self-control and self-discipline. It makes it okay to lie to yourself, and that makes you weaker, which makes it more likely, I think, for you to continue lying to yourself. If one cookie is okay, two must also be okay — after all, one wasn’t a problem. Then you’re eating three, because if two’s okay since one’s okay, then one more cookie makes no difference. Pretty soon, the world runs out of cookies.

Let’s not forget the other lie you’ve told yourself: that the cookie is not poison for your body, and that it is okay in the first place to ingest it. It’s not, and we know this thanks to science. Junk food is bad for you. It makes you sick, and allowing yourself to eat it is lying to yourself that it does not make you sick, and it is not bad for you. But here’s the rub: you may not notice the effects of that junk food on your body.

One of my favorite classes in high school was sports science. In it, we learned about the athletism and the body. One time, in discussing nutrition, my teacher challenged us to forgo McDonald’s and other fast food choices for three weeks to seek how it affected you. I took him up on it and went six weeks without fast food. After six weeks, I went to McDonald’s and bought a premium chicken sandwich, which made me sick after I ate it. It gave me terrible indigestion — I was writhing in pain. When I reported this to my teacher, he emphasized his point: “See! The premium chicken sandwich!” That challenge made me realize that we don’t notice how our diets make us feel, and that’s a bad thing because it allows us to lie to ourselves about our diets and other things.

When faced with facts, we may choose to lie because the facts don’t appear true to us. “Nutritionists say food from McDonald’s is bad for you,” you might say, “But that must not be true since when I eat McDonald’s, I don’t feel bad. Therefore, McDonald’s is not bad for me.” But you don’t consider that you’re used to the bad effect eating of McDonald’s. You’re choosing to ignore that possibility or you’re ignorant of it.

With every lie made and believed, it’s easier to make another, and at a certain low point, one stops realizing they are lying to themselves. They engage the autopilot, and their indulgence takes them to where ever their weaknesses can be found. That might be, for me at one point, the school’s Starbucks cafe, where I could buy coffee drinks and a chocolate muffin for breakfast before class. In other cases, it might be in your car, where you are scraping together \$3.20 in change so you can run into McDonald’s for two McChickens and a large coke.

This is the point I’m trying to make: self-discipline is all or nothing, and there’s no in-between. You cannot lie to yourself that it’s okay to eat junk food 20% of the time, because it’s not. It sets the precedent that 22% is okay as well. Soon, you're at 30%, and so on. The only way to ensure that you don’t slip is to make the rule exact: 100% of the time, I will not indulge in junk food. Maybe far into the future, after you’ve won leniency, you can reduce to 99% of the time.

It’s very tempting to apply this method to every bad habit you have, but that’s setting yourself up for failure. Instead, apply self-discipline like a scalpel: you want swift, clean cuts that are precise. Today, it may be cutting junk food from your diet. Once this habit is cut, then you move on to the next one. The culmination of precise cuts is what produces self-discipline in the long run.

And that’s the vital point: Why do we develop self-discipline? To be good to our future selves, to set them up for happiness and success. We are driven or should be driven to accomplish important goals in our lives. We cannot do that if we lack the discipline to apply our efforts to those goals. It is through discipline that we have the chance to succeed in our endeavors; it is through discipline that we can stop being weak, and live up to our potential.
