One of my favorite songs is "Today" by The Smashing Pumpkins for these lyrics:

> *Today is the greatest / Day I've ever known / Can't wait for tomorrow /* *I might* *not have that long.*

They remind me that my life is finite; that today I could die; that tomorrow isn't promised; that every day is a gift; and that I should be grateful for my life today.
