I think an important lesson to know is how to manage one's obligations, including their tasks, goals, courses, and work, et cetera, so that they remain as productive as possible. There exist many methods for this already, but this essay will explore my solution, which is a combination of a few I like best.

First, the tools that I use: Notion, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Grammarly, Gmail, and Outlook. Non-digital tools include paper, pens, my Kindle, and notebooks. Notion is my app for my day-to-day goings, and I use Google Drive as cloud storage for files and big projects.

Second, I bullet journal. I have a journal in Notion, in which there are pages for the month, day, checklists, previews, and reviews. There are also pages for habits. The method here is simple: on the month page, I keep important tasks and events that occurred logged; on the day pages, I keep my tasks, events, notes, checklists, and journal entries.

For tasks, I use checkboxes. I tag each task with its importance, using a major or minor scheme. A major task must be completed that day as it is important. A minor task is optional; complete it if you can, but do not worry about not completing it as it's not as important. But the point is to complete all of the tasks that I set each day. To monitor this, I have a completion score, which is the percentage of tasks I completed over the total tasks. The goal is 100%. If I have uncompleted tasks, I must note why I failed to complete them.

For notes and events, I record these as they come in addition to what new tasks come up. Each evening, I compile tasks into a new day and add those to my Calendar. I review this Calendar in the morning to know what I have going for the day.

To keep myself focused and productive, I use checklists for as much as I can. I have checklists for morning and evening rituals, writing, reading, health, study, research, et cetera. Checklists allow me to know at a glance what has been accomplished and what has not. This is a powerful tool for keeping tabs on my progression, and I recommend you adopt it.

Lastly, I journal twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. I call my morning entry the day's "preview" and the ending entry the day's "review." In both, I have my creed which I am to read. Then, I have six questions to answer. For the preview, I ask myself:

1. What am I lacking in attaining freedom from passion? What for tranquility?
2. I am a rational being. What is demanded of me, and what are my actions?
3. How did I steer away from serenity? What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring? What did I fail to do in all of these things?
4. What three things am I grateful for?
5. What three things can make today great?
6. I am... (Daily affirmation).

And for the review, I ask myself:

1. What did I attempt today and what did I accomplish? What did I not complete?
2. What bad habit did I curb today, and how am I better for it?
3. What have I learned? What progress have I made?
4. Were my actions just? Who have I helped?
5. Is this who I want to be? Is this everything that I can give? Is this going to be my life? Do I accept that?
6. How can I improve?

These questions are a combination of Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Jocko Willink, and 5 Minute Journaling. Together, I think they provide an excellent reflection for the day.

I use PARA of Tiago Forte for organizing my files: PARA stands for projects, areas, resources, and archives. Projects are activities that have due dates with predetermined goals, such as "make a new deep work checklist by Monday." Areas are reoccurring activities of my life, such as my writing or studies. Resources are anything that helps me to do better in living, working, learning, et cetera. Two examples are my book notes and web development notes. Finally, archives are projects, areas, or resources that I am no longer interested in or are no longer relevant to me. I apply this method to Notion and Google Drive, and it keeps me quite organized because of its simplicity and flexibility.

I write notes on paper first, unless it's more practical to do it in Notion. I write notes because studies show that writing them over digital-notetaking improves retention and learning. Plus, I get a second chance at refining them as I digitize them, which allows me to easily break them into chunks for studying with Anki.

I keep these notes clipped together and hung on my wall next to my desk. They wait there until I add to them or digitize them. In addition to that stack are reminders pinned to the wall: I keep a list of mantras, my creed, and my one-sentence legacy. These remind me of who I am working to be and the standard I have to maintain.

Altogether, these methods have transformed my productivity. I get more quality work done in less time, and I am grateful for that. I encourage anyone to explore and adopt strategies that improve the productivity and quality of their work.
