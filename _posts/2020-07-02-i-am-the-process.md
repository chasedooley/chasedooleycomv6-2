Alan Watts said once that we define ourselves as being only a result of the process. He said:

> Billions of years ago, you were a big bang, but now you're a complicated human being. And then we cut ourselves off, and don't feel that we're still the big bang. But you are. Depends how you define yourself. ... You're not something that is a sort of puppet on the end of the process. You are still the process. You are the big bang, the original force of the universe, coming on as whoever you are.

I tell myself often that I am the process. I am not the result of change, but I am change itself. Who I am and who I am becoming and who I want to become are all one, ever-shifting underneath, revealing themselves in varying degrees. Self-change is not the alternation of body and self, but rather the revealing of one's true self.
