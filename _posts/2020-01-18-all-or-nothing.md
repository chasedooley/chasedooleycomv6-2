What can a neuron teach us about making decisions? Well, for a neuron to pass an electrical charge it receives from another cell, that charge must meet a certain standard. It must be strong enough to pass a threshold, which is to say that the stimulus must be important enough to warrant the signal to the spine and brain. If the electrical impulse does meet the standard, then the neuron fires, continuing it to the next neuron. If that charge does not meet the standard, the neuron will not fire. This is called an “all or nothing” response.

You should apply an “all or nothing” response to every decision in your life. It is [Derek Sivers’s “Hell Yeah or No”](https://sivers.org/hellyeah "Derek Sivers: No “yes.” Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”") approach explained another way. If an idea or job comes along that makes you wildly excited about, in such a way that you might respond, “Hell Yeah,” then, you should do it. Else, if that thing gets a “Yes” response, then it’s a “No,” just as if that idea gets a “No” in the first place.

The point is to cut wasteful use of energy. The neuron doesn’t want to fire if it doesn’t have to, as that would waste its potential, causing the neuron time to recharge before it can fire again. This is to say that the neuron only wants to fire when it needs to. Likewise, if you agree to every Yes that comes your way, then you would waste your energy on ideas that won’t have a large impact compared to the Hell Yeah ideas. You only want to work on ideas that you absolutely want to.

To do otherwise is a waste of energy better spent on better ideas. You may even work on projects that make you miserable, and in that regard, I have a personal example: the web development of my sites. The idea started simply: a Yes, I want them a particular way, so I’ll design and develop the sites myself. However, because I never feel satisfied with the results that I’ve made, feeling as if there’s more to be done or stuff to tweak, the project makes me miserable. I'm rarely satisfied with the results I produced. I spent a year trying to produce something I was happy to publish, but I rarely did.

Having realized the project makes me miserable, I questioned my motives — why is it necessary that _I_ build my sites? It’s not. I was doing the project for personal goals so that I could say I did it myself since I wanted them a particular way. I wanted to show off my ability to develop good-looking, usable websites. So, why didn’t I quit when I first realized the project wasn’t going well?

I think it’s because of the sunk cost fallacy. I invested a lot of time and effort into the project that I did not want to abandon what I had done over another’s work. As such, I continued with it trying to make it successful, hoping that the end is near, but it never was. If I had just considered the project with the “Hell Yeah or No” approach, then I would have said no, and saved myself a lot of time and anguish.

That’s the tricky business with a “Yes” idea: it may be “No” in disguise trying to make you miserable and waste your time. It may seem reasonable, and you may even rationalize why you should do it. And those rationalizations may be true, even downright convincing, but the fact remains that the idea isn’t as valuable as a “Hell Yeah,” and it’s likely to cause more trouble than its worth.

This is why we must be diligent in our selection. It is easy to start a project that seems harmless, such as my websites, only to have them turn sour on you. It’s easy for you to become your biggest obstacle when you continuously choose projects that make you miserable, and when you continue to work on those projects even after you decided they’re not worth it. It’s easy for you to stick to a project even if it makes you miserable. Sometimes a “Yes” idea or project is Resistance trying to destroy you in a new way.
