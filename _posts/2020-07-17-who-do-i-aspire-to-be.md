> *The essence of wisdom is to aspire to be none other than yourself.*

Who do I aspire to be? Myself, as the greatest realization of my potential being. Self-actualization is the aspiration of being just oneself. What is simpler than living to one's essential being, which is already simple in its effects? Bruce Lee said that being real in person is the only thing we can ask of our lives.

So many of us choose not to be real. We'd rather become someone we're not than be who we're meant to be. We're very good at self-image actualization. We ignore the risk that we're misliving our lives.

I don't want to mislive my life.
