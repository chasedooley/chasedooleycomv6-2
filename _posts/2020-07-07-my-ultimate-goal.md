My goal is much the same. "I suppose my ultimate goal is simply to remain on the road which I am now on, to comprehend what's at the center of who I am." Since I am the process, I am the universe in one instance of itself. Then, my goal is to comprehend the universe too. To comprehend the universe from my unique point of view, and to share what I discover in hope that others too find a similar discovery.
